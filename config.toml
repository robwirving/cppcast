He started the CppCast podcast in February 2015, frustrated by the lack of podcast content for C++ development.\n\nA believer in continuous education, he loves learning about new technologies, often through podcasts!"

He is the co-creator and maintainer of ChaiScript, a mature scripting language designed for modern C++. He is also the creator and curator of cppbestpractices.com an effort to gather the collective wisdom of the C++ community.\n\n[Contact Jason](http://articles.emptycrate.com/contact.html) if you are interested in having on-site C++ training for your company."
