David Stone has spoken at C++Now and Meeting C++. He is the author of the bounded::integer library: http://doublewise.net/c++/bounded/ and has a 
special interest in compile-time code generation and error checking, as well as machine learning. He owns DoubleWise C++ Consulting, providing on-site training with an emphasis on performance and correctness. He also 
works at Markit integrating real-time financial data. He once wrote an optimizing compiler that solved the halting problem, and is just waiting for it to finish compiling his program.
