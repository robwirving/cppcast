Nicolas Guillemot started studying C++ and OpenGL to make games, and fell in love with them. He enjoys participating in game jams, and has had the opportunity to work in some game development studios: Inlight Entertainment, and Electronic Arts. He is currently taking a break from finishing a bachelor's in software engineering to work at Intel, doing mostly graphics-related work to help game developers take advantage of Intel GPU features.
