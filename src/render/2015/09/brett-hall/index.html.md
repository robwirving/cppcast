Brett Hall is the lead engineer on Dynamics, a desktop application that collects and analyzes data from the light scattering instruments built by Wyatt technology. Prior to joining Wyatt, Brett worked in web application development, remote sensing, and spent a summer in the games industry. He holds a PhD in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Part of his research work involved using C++ to solve the PDE systems generated by the rest of the research. All told he’s been using C++ for around 20 years now. These days the bulk of his programming interest is in concurrency and parallelism. When not programming he’s usually hanging out with his family and/or mountain biking.
