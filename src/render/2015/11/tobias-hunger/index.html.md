Tobias graduated from the University of Kaiserslautern in Germany with a degree in computer engineering. Before joining Nokia in 2009 to work on Qt Creator he has been a consultant, specializing in systems administration and later Qt software development. He went with Qt to Digia and now works for The Qt Company in Berlin, Germany.
 
Tobias has been an open source contributor ever since his student days and is now a maintainer in the Qt project, responsible for the version control plugins in Qt Creator. He also is heavily involved with the project management plugins.
 
In his spare time he does way to many computer related things, but also manages to read books, go to the movies and play with his son.
