Sohail Somani is a contract cross-platform application developer who has been working in C++ and Python for over 10 years. He has worked in a variety of fields such as computer graphics, C++ compilers, finance and plain old desktop apps. Sohail's obsession with (or hate of) time tracking led him to create Worklog Assistant, a cross-platform time tracker for JIRA, which is in use by more than a thousand companies worldwide. He hopes to one day achieve time tracking nirvana for his users so that he can finally move on to something else. He might be too optimistic...
 
Otherwise, Sohail is a full-time, work-at-home dad of 2 since 2007. He enjoys playing hockey and listening to rap music. You can contact him at hello@sohailsomani.com - but he doesn't recommend that you visit the domain.
