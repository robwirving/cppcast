Daniel lives in Stockholm, Sweden with his wife and son. He has a degree in electronics but has never worked as an electronics engineer. Daniel works as a consultant at Evidente in Sweden which provides consultants and contractors for embedded software development and static analysis.
Daniel started Cppcheck almost 10 years ago as a hobby project that he works on in his spare time. Daniel sometimes works on other hobby projects such as an open source retro mobile phone with a rotary dial plate instead of buttons or a screen.
