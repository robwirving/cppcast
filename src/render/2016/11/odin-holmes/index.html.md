Odin Holmes has been programming bare metal embedded systems for 15+ years and as any honest nerd admits most of that time was spent debugging his stupid mistakes. With the advent of the 100x speed up of template metaprogramming provided by C++11 his current mission began: teach the compiler to find his stupid mistakes at compile time so he has more free time for even more template metaprogramming. Odin Holmes is the author of the Kvasir.io library, a DSL which wraps bare metal special function register interactions allowing full static checking and a considerable efficiency gain over common practice. He is also active in building and refining the tools need for this task such as the brigand MPL library, a replacement candidate for boost.parameter and a better public API for boost.MSM-lite.
