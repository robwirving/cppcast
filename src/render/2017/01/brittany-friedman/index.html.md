Brittany Friedman is a dense collection of matter formed from molecules originating inside the sun. She currently works as a programmer at Gearbox Software, where she weaves ones and zeroes into intricate little patterns. Her proposal for new memory management algorithms was accepted for C++17 and a bug that she filed against the C++ standard was fixed the way that she recommended. So basically you do not want to trifle with her.
