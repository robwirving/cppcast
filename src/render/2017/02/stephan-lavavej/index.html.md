Stephan T. Lavavej is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft, maintaining Visual C++'s implementation of the C++ Standard Library since 2007. He also designed a couple of C++14 features: make_unique and the transparent operator functors. He likes his initials (which people can actually spell) and cats (although he doesn't own any).
